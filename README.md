Written by Chris North for the Planck Royal Society Summer Science Exhibition 2013 as an educational resource.

This application requires Chromoscope v1.4.3.
The relevant parts of the Chromoscope source code (1.4.3 subdirectory) are included here for convenience, but have not been altered.
It will run locally or on a web server. To run locally you will need to download this code, and either link to the online tilesets or download them from www.chromoscope.net/planck/download.

The IDL code used to plot the images is in IDL_code directory.
See the contents of plot_maps.pro for details.
