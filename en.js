    "intro" : "This page lets you browse the maps that Planck has made of the sky at nine microwave and mm-wave wavelengths, using the <a href=\"http://chromoscope.net\">Chromoscope</a> interface. The sky looks different when viewed at different wavelengths. As well as the Cosmic Microwave Background, it also shows emission from our own Galaxy and others. Looking at all these wavelengths allows Planck to identify and separate the light from a wide range of objects.
